The default Gatsby starter

A basic blog project with Gatsby, [based on the FreeCodeCamp Walkthrough](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-to-build-a-react-and-gatsby-powered-blog-in-about-10-minutes-625c35c06481)

For an overview of the project structure please refer to the [Gatsby documentation - Building with Components](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/building-with-components/)

gatsby new gatsby-example-site
```
